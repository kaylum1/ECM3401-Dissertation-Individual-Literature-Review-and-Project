        <h1>Do Not Track (DNT) Support Scan - Understanding Online Privacy</h1>
        <p>This page will break down and explains Do Not Track (DNT) support scans, what it means when a scan does not detect anything, how users can be exposed, and the scientific process behind how these scans work.</p>

        <h2>What is Do Not Track (DNT)?</h2>
        <p>Do Not Track (DNT) is a browser feature that lets people signal to websites that they prefer not to be tracked. When switched on, the browser adds the DNT: 1 HTTP header to each request, asking sites not to collect or share user information for advertising or analytics.</p>

        <p>Although DNT was proposed as a web standard, it is not legally binding, and many sites overlook—or deliberately ignore the header.</p>

        <p>While DNT was initially designed as a web standard, it is not legally enforceable, and many websites ignore it.</p>

        <h2>What Happens When a DNT Support Scan Shows Nothing?</h2>
        <p>If a scan does not detect Do Not Track support, it may indicate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The website does not recognise or respect the DNT header.</li>
            <li>The website collects and shares user data regardless of user preferences.</li>
            <li>The website relies on third-party trackers that do not adhere to DNT.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A lack of DNT support means the website may track user behaviour even if users have opted out through their browser settings.</p>

        <h2>How Users are Left Exposed Without DNT Support</h2>
        <p>When websites ignore Do Not Track requests, users may face several risks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Behavioral Tracking:</strong> Websites can track your browsing activity across different sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Targeted Advertising:</strong> Your data may be shared with advertisers, leading to invasive personalized ads.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Violations:</strong> Websites may store and analyze personal data without user consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> If collected data is not securely stored, it may be exposed in breaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Profiling:</strong> Companies can build detailed digital profiles of users, including their habits, preferences, and demographics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Online Tracking</h2>
        <p>Because many sites ignore DNT, users should adopt extra safeguards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Privacy-Focused Browsers:</strong> Firefox, Brave, or Tor Browser add stronger tracking defences.</li>
            <li><strong>Install Tracker-Blocking Extensions:</strong> Add-ons such as Privacy Badger or uBlock Origin block tracking scripts.</li>
            <li><strong>Disable Third-Party Cookies:</strong> Browser settings can block cookies from external domains.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a VPN:</strong> A virtual private network masks your IP address from trackers.</li>
            <li><strong>Regularly Clear Cookies:</strong> Deleting stored cookies removes long-term tracking data.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt Out of Data Collection:</strong> Some sites let you refine tracking choices in privacy settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Science Behind Do Not Track Scanning</h2>
        <p>Do Not Track scanners check for DNT support by analyzing HTTP headers and website responses. The process includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sending a DNT Request:</strong> The scanner makes an HTTP request that includes the DNT: 1 header.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring Server Response:</strong> It checks whether the site acknowledges or ignores the header.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysing Privacy Policies:</strong> Some tools examine the site’s privacy notice for DNT language.</li>
            <li><strong>Checking Tracking Behaviour:</strong> The scanner looks for tracking scripts that remain active.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Websites Should Support Do Not Track</h2>
        <p>Although DNT is voluntary, websites that respect it benefit in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Building User Trust:</strong> Transparency about tracking improves credibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with Privacy Laws:</strong> Supporting DNT aligns with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Reducing Security Risks:</strong> Collecting less data minimizes exposure in case of a breach.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving User Experience:</strong> Some users prefer websites that do not track them for advertising purposes.</li>
        </ul>
