    <h2>Understanding the Dashboard</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Score Banner</h3>
    <p>
      At the top, you will see the <strong>Score Banner</strong>. It indicates the overall security and privacy score for the current website.
      If it says <em>"Not changed"</em>, it means the score hasn't changed recently.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Website URL</h3>
    <p>
      Just below the score, the <strong>URL</strong> of the site you're scanning is displayed. 
      This helps you know which page is currently being analyzed.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Overall Score Circle</h3>
    <p>
      The large colored circle shows a <strong>numerical score</strong> (e.g., 10 out of 10).
      - Green color indicates a good score.<br>
      - Yellow or red color (if it appears) indicates issues needing attention.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Scan Failure Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Underneath the score, a message like <em>"1 out of 22 scans failed"</em> appears.
      This tells you how many issues were found in the scan.
      If there are failures, it's a good idea to investigate and fix them.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Navigation Buttons</h3>
    <p>
      At the bottom, you’ll find a series of <strong>Navigation Buttons</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Security</strong> — View all security scan results.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy</strong> — View all privacy scan results.</li>
        <li><strong>Metrics</strong> — View performance-related metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Logs</strong> — View logs of previous scans.</li>
        <li><strong>Settings</strong> — Adjust extension settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Edu</strong> — Educational content about different scans.</li>
        <li><strong>Help</strong> — (this page) Learn how the extension works.</li>
      </ul>
      Clicking any button will navigate you to the corresponding page for more details.
    </p>

    <h2>Tips for Best Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always check both <strong>Security</strong> and <strong>Privacy</strong> sections after a scan.</li>
      <li>If you see a low score, explore the details provided under each scan type.</li>
      <li>Use the <strong>Education</strong> section ("Edu") to better understand what each scan checks for and why it's important.</li>
