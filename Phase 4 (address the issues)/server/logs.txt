5 feb - 10 change the whole structure as i could not add my own sql databse\
11 - have my own sql database and have added\
12 - reploshing different scans and have added privacy scans \
13- adding info when there is a bad score - first will be red then gonna add info on it \
14- added the setup of new tabs that have evern more information - more needs to be done \
14 - help strcture be better, automated the server database and scans and now when going on new tabe upadted automatically, also only upadted database after a week\
14- created the fram work to have tabs open for scan with poor result and now they need poplulating with information \
\
14 created an XAmap and DVWA enviroment for tesing the different scans work correctly\

14 creating dumby websites to make sure that my websites works corretcly 
15. created a templates folder and not easier tot recaret webistes with seducirty issues 


17 i have addeed features such as vpn and ad blocker 


18 created a new fully dledge scan and had to reasbbombe the database to first and make sure they wrre paossive so they are legal

19 gave functnaility to the cookies and and ad blocker 

20 created fake webpage that will purppsley fail all the scan 

21 cereated the new educatoanla

22 created a new scaoring matrix that will allow me to adjust the weights of the different scans 


24 start of adversal porject here 
    - will create different weigjt configurations that user will be able to chose from 

24 created a metrics page where poeple can pick the weights based on what they want 

24 - set up the weight with the reason stated below 


-----------------------------------------------
PRECONFIGURED_WEIGHTS = {
    "normal": [8, 7, 5, 5, 9, 9, 7, 5, 3, 4, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7],
    ...
}
XSS (8) & Vulnerability (7): These are high‐risk vulnerabilities.
Privacy Tracker (5) & Third-party Script (5): Moderately important in normal use.
SSL (9) & SQL (9): Critical for secure communications and backend safety.
Security Headers (7): Important for overall site security.
Privacy Audit (5): Important but balanced with other concerns.
Performance (3): Lower importance in a security/privary context.
Outdated (4): Moderate importance.
Mixed Content (7): Critical to avoid insecure content.
Directory (5): Moderate risk.
CSRF (8), CSP (8), HTTPS (8): High importance to prevent attacks.
Third-party Data Collection (7): Important for privacy.
Tracker Detection (7) & Fingerprinting (7): Privacy issues.
Referrer & DNT (5): Moderate.
Data Leakage (7): High risk.
DNT (5): Moderate.
Cookie (7): Important for session and privacy.

-----------------------------------------------
Security Profile

Here the focus is on classic security vulnerabilities, so scans that check for XSS, SQL injection, SSL, headers, and CSRF are given higher weights. Privacy-related scans receive lower emphasis.

"security": [10, 10, 2, 2, 10, 10, 9, 2, 2, 5, 9, 7, 10, 10, 10, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 5],
XSS (10) & Vulnerability (10): Maximum importance.
Privacy Tracker (2) & Third-party Script (2): Lower because focus is on security flaws.
SSL (10) & SQL (10): Critical.
Headers (9): Very important.
Privacy Audit (2): Lower priority.
Performance (2): Minimal in a security profile.
Outdated (5): Moderate.
Mixed (9): High priority.
Directory (7): Important.
CSRF (10), CSP (10), HTTPS (10): Very high.
Third-party Data Collection (3), Tracker Detection (3), Fingerprinting (3): Lower.
Referrer & DNT (2): Minimal.
Data Leakage (8): High.
DNT (2): Minimal.
Cookie (5): Moderate.


-----------------------------------------------
Privacy Profile

Privacy-related scans are emphasized; vulnerability checks not directly related to privacy get lower weights.

"privacy": [3, 3, 10, 10, 4, 4, 3, 10, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 10, 10, 10, 10, 8, 8, 10],
XSS (3) & Vulnerability (3): Lower emphasis since they’re less privacy-specific.
Privacy Tracker (10) & Third-party Script (10): Maximum weight.
SSL (4) & SQL (4): Important, but not as much as privacy concerns.
Headers (3): Lower priority.
Privacy Audit (10): Maximum importance.
Performance (2) & Outdated (2): Minimal.
Mixed (3) & Directory (3): Low.
CSRF (3), CSP (3): Lower.
HTTPS (4): Moderate.
Third-party Data Collection (10), Tracker Detection (10), Fingerprinting (10): Critical for privacy.
Referrer & DNT (10): Maximum (since leaking referrer info or not respecting DNT is a privacy risk).
Data Leakage (8): High.
DNT (8): High.
Cookie (10): Maximum, as cookies are a major privacy concern.
